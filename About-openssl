#OpenSSL Discussion Summary
#This document summarizes our discussion on the usage of OpenSSL to manage SSL/TLS certificates, including commands for extracting certificate information, downloading certificates, and converting certificate formats.
#Extracting SSL/TLS Certificate Information
#To extract and display the SSL/TLS certificate of a website in a readable format, the following command can be used:

echo | openssl s_client -connect www.google.com:443 | openssl x509 -text -noout


#This command chain uses OpenSSL to retrieve the SSL/TLS certificate from the specified server (in this case, www.google.com on port 443) and displays it in a human-readable form, showing details such as the issuer, validity period, and more.
#Downloading SSL/TLS Certificates
#To download an SSL/TLS certificate from a server and save it to a file, the following command is used:

openssl s_client -connect [hostname]:[port] -showcerts </dev/null | openssl x509 -outform PEM > certificate.pem

#This command connects to the specified host and port, retrieves the full SSL/TLS certificate chain, and saves it to a file in PEM format.
#Converting Certificate Formats (PEM to CRT)
#To convert a PEM format certificate to CRT format, which may be necessary for certain applications, the following command can be used:


openssl x509 -in your_certificate.pem -outform DER -out your_certificate.crt

#This command converts the certificate from PEM (base64 encoded) to DER (binary) format and renames it to a .crt extension, as required by some systems.
