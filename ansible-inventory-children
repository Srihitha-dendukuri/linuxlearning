group2
[group1]
servername1.mylabserver.com

#example: you can define web as the main host group in the playbook and if you wants
to do rolling deployment on group1 first and then group2 next then you have to arrange 
the group1 and group2 as children to web
->ansible-playbook -i inventory-filename playbook.yml --limit group1 #once it is validated by QA then it can go to group2
-> ansible-playbook -i inventory-filename playbook.yml --limit group2

#FORKS
#if you wants to randomaly deploy two servers at a time in the parent group web host then use forks 
ansible-playbook -i inventory-filename playbook.yml --forks=2 #note: make sure that web is already defind in the playbook.yml
